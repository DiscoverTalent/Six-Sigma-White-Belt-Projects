# 📘 Case Study 2 – Library Late Return Problem  

## Background  
At the college library, students often return books **after the due date**. On average, around **40% of books are returned late**. Because of this, other students cannot access important books on time, and the library staff spends extra effort sending reminders and charging fines.  

This causes:  
- Students missing study materials  
- Extra workload for library staff  
- Negative student feedback about the library
