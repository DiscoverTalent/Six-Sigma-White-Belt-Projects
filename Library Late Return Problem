At PGDAV College library, students often return books late. Because of this, other students cannot access the books they need. On average, 40% of books are returned after the due date. The library has to send reminders and sometimes charge fines.

This causes:

Students not finding books on time
Extra workload for library staff
Negative student feedback

Your Task (DMAIC Approach)

Define
What is the exact problem? Who is affected?

Measure

(At least 2–3 reasons. Example: Students forget, due dates not visible, library timings clash with classes).

Improve
Suggest 2–3 practical solutions.
(Example: Email reminders before due date, WhatsApp notification, small extension policy).

Control
How will you ensure improvements stay long-term?
(Example: Automatic system alerts, periodic monitoring by librarian).
